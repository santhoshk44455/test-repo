Linux file system structure
---------------------------
/  --> root folder for lnux server

boot --> when server is getting strated, server refers this directory and config from grub.cfg
dev --> devices --> external devices are mounted here
etc --> extra configaration
home --> users home directory are created here
lib/lib64 --> system needs libraries are presnt here
/media --> cd/dvd drive
/mnt --> extra disks mount here
/opt --> optional,manual installation of services or applications will be downloaded here
/poc --> running process will store here with their PID
/proc/cpuinfo
/proc/meminfo

/root --> root user home folder
/run --> when server starts,server uses this directory as storage
/bin --> cat,vim,touch,cd
/sbin --> system commands like root access commands
/temp --> temporary files not important
/usr --> all users,
/var --> variables --> log files

symlink vs hardlink (imp interview question)
-------------------------------------------
symlink:
  first create a file using touch command'
touch hello
ln -s /home/ec2-user/hello /tmp/hello-soft
here s stands for symlink
symlink will have the different inode location

hardlink:
hardlink wil have the same inode location as the actual file inode location
ln /home/ec2-user/hello hello-hard

symlink will point out the file,if we delete that file it will not be there
hardlink will be good,we can get the content from hello-hard location

cat hello-hard
hello world
cat hello-soft
no such file or directory
