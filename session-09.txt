what is Deployment(manual deployment)
------------------
if we want to dosome changes developer will update the code.he will push the code to some location as zip file.
-> download the new code
-> stop the server --> stop catalogue
-> remove old code
-> unzip new code
-> restart the server
in this we have downtime 

syncronous vs asyncronous
--------------------------
http/https --> syncronous
in syncronous communication server should be always up and running
if the server is not running then we are getting 400 or 500 errors

asyncronous
-----------
client --> messaging broker --> server

sivakumar --> ramesh

there will be a queue for ramesh

sivakumar --> ramesh queue

ramesh whatsap --> subsribed to ramesh queue

ifonline --> message will be delivered

when ramesh gets online --> ramesh whatsp --> ramesh queue
