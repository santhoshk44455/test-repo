DNS
----
DNS stands for Domain Name System
when we type facebook.com in the browser first it will check in the browser cache for the IP address.
if the IP address is not in the browser cache,it will connect to the OS for the IP address for facebook.com.
it will check in the OS cache also for the IP address for facebook.com
ISP resolver --> DNS resolution is a responsibility of ISP
if it is not there in the OS cache the OS will connect to the ISP resolver for the IP address of facebook.com
ISP resolver will check in the ISPresolver cache for the facebook.com IP address.
ISP resolver is configured with root servers.
few organizations voluntarily formed root servers
root servers --> 13 servers are there across worldwide and they are backed by many servers for load balancing.
ISP will now contact the root servers,these root servers have TLD information i.e(Top Level domain) information.

.com --> popular
.in --> Indian gov will manage, .uk, .us,.au,.eu
.org --> non profit organizations
.net
.gov
.online
.ai

Root servers --> TLD info is provided to ISP resolver
ISP resolver --> .com TLD
.com TLD --> nameservers information
