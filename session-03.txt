Network Management
------------------
netstat --> network statistics

netstat -lntp --> this command is used to check whether the ports are running or not
l -> listing
n -> port number
t -> tcp protocol
p -> process

sudo netstat -lntp -> this will gives the process id also.

troubleshooting:
-----------------
system resources
  CPU memory -> by using top command we can check the cpu usage
  HD full -> df -ht commnd
  RAM full -> free --help or free -m
after this we have to check whether the process is running or not --> ps -ef | grep nginx
after that we have to check whether the port is opened or not --> netstat -lntp
then we have to check for whether the service is running or not by using below command
systemctl status <service>
then we have to check for whether the firewall is opened or not

how to give access to linux user
-------------------------------
There are 2 types of users
1. Linux Admin --> full access to linux
2. Devops Admin --> limited sudo access
first we need to create the group for admin and devops team by using the following command
groupadd admin
groupadd devops

ramesh --> he is the admin person
suresh --> he is the devops person

First we need to create the user ramesh
useradd ramesh
usermod -g admin ramesh --> by using this command we are adding the ramesh user to the admin group

useradd suresh
usermod -g devops suresh --> by using this cmd we are adding the suresh to the devops group

how to give access to the above 2 persons?
vim /etc/sudoers or
vi sudo --> this will open the file in safemode
we are going to add the ramesh to wheel group or give admin group full access
%admin  ALL=(ALL)  ALL

[root@IP]# vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
in this file we need to enable the password authentication,afterwards restart the sshd service
[root@IP]# systemctl restart sshd

ssh ramesh@IPAddress --> now connected

[ramesh@IP]$ sudo yum install git -y

now we need to give the limited sudo access to the devops person
[root@IP]# vi sudo
%devops  ALL=(ALL)  /usr/bin/yum,/usr/bin/systemctl
now the devops group user has only yum and systemctl rights

instead of directly opning the sudoers file,we will create sudoers.d file
[root@IP]# vim /etc/sudoers.d/devops
in this file we will give the access
%devops  ALL(ALL)    /usr/bin/yum,/usr/bin/systemctl

3 tier architecture
