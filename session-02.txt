permissions
-----------
- rw-    rw-    r--
  user  group  others
  u     g      o
R -> 4
W -> 2
X -> 1 -> to run commnds and shell scripts
santhoshkumar --> Devops Team
user=owner
group=devops
ohers=testing,development team

in Linux when we create user, a group with same name will be created
santhoshkumar --> user santhsohkumar and group with name santhoshkumar also created

in order to change the permissions we will use the chmod command

chmod u+x sample --> this means we are giving the execution permission for the user

chmod ugo+r sample

sample

u --> RWX
g --> R
o --> 0
chmod 740 example.txt


--> the user get read,write and execution permissions
--> the group get only read permissions
--> others will not get any permission

u --> RWX
q --> RX
o --> X
chmod 751 example.txt

--> the user get read,write and execute permissions
--> thr group get read,write permissions
--> others will get execute permission

User Management:
---------------
suppose if santhosh is the new person who joined the devops team
1. create user
useradd <user-name>
passwd <user-name>

/etc/passwd --> will have user entries
when the user is created, automaticaly group is created with same username

getent groups --> this commnd will gives us the all the group entries
now the user has to login,then we need to do the small configaration
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
in this configaration file generally linux will disable the password authentication,now we have to enable it manually,afterwards run a small command
/etc/ssh/sshd_config --> enable passwd authentication
sshd -t --> checks for syntax of the file
systemctl restart sshd

ssh santhoshkumar@ipaddress
password: santhoshkumar

now we have successfully logged in as the santhoshkumar user.
if we type pwd --> /home/santhoshkumar

2. group
groupadd <group-name> --> command to add new group
groupadd devops

3.every user will have a primary group and secondary group
santhoshkumar should be added to devops group

usermod -g devops santhoshkumar

chown --> even file owner cant run this commands
only sudo user can change the ownership
chown <user>:<group> filename
chown <user>:<group> -R folder
4. we will create testing group,we will give santhoshkumar secondary access.
groupadd testing

usermod -aG testing santhoshkumar

gpasswd -d santhoshkumar testing --> deletes santhoshkumar from testing group

user is leaving organization
----------------------------
userdel <user-name> ---> removes user from linux

first user should be removed from the group

process management
-------------------
if we follow the process we will get best results

everything in linux is a process

Team Leader
Team Manager
Account Manager
Senior Engineer
Junior Engineer
Trainee

Team Leader --> 1 ticket created about devops pipelines setup = 1
senior engineer --> 1
sub task -> 2 --> Junior Engineer
sub task -> 3 --> Junior Engineer-2
Junior Engineer
---------------
sub task --> 4 --> trainee
create a CI pipeline --> task completed
ticket 4 --> task completed

task ID --> 4 , parent task --> 3
task 3 --> task 1

whatever we do in linux --> a process id will be created and reported back

package management
------------------
yum command is used to install packages --> RHEL =centos = fedora = AWS Linux2
amazon-linux-extras
yum install package-name
yum remove git -y

suppose raheem joined,how can we enable ssh access
--------------------------------------------------through private key
-------------------
step 1: create raheem user
useradd raheem
step 2: we will send a mail to raheem..give me your public key,keep your private key securely
[root]# useradd raheem
[root]# cd/home/raheem
[root]# mkdir .ssh
after creating the .ssh folder,now raheem has to generate the key
[user]$ ssh-keygen -f raheem
[user]$ raheem.pub 
now he will give this public key

700
user --> RWX
group
others
[root@IP raheem]# chmod -R 700 .ssh
[root@IP raheem]# cd .ssh/
[root@IP .ssh]# vim authorized_keys
now in this file we have to paste the raheems public key here
[root@IP .ssh]# chmod 400 authorized_keys
[root@IP raheem]# chown -R raheem:raheem .ssh
