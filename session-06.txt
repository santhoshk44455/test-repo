VPN --> virtual private network

servers are not aware of clients behind VPN
VPN can be used for anonymous access ie hiding our identity
in forward proxy servers dont know who the real clients are

security --> companies can impose restrictions not to use particular sites,file uploads, to monitor user behaviour

clients are aware of proxy,servers are not aware

reverse proxy
